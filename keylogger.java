Keylogging and Keyloggers
Keyloggers, or keystroke loggers, are tools that record what a person types on a device. While there are legitimate and legal uses for keyloggers, many uses for keyloggers are malicious. In a keylogger attack, the keylogger software records every keystroke on the victim’s device and sends it to the attacker.
It’s important to protect yourself from keylogger attacks used by malicious users. Because keyloggers can record and quickly identify sensitive information, they are a significant threat to cybersecurity. To protect yourself, it’s important to know what keyloggers are, how to prevent an attack and how to remove a keylogger if you are attacked.
Keyloggers aren’t always used for illegal purposes. Consider the following examples of legal uses for keylogging software:
Parents might use a keylogger to monitor a child’s screen time.
Companies often use keylogger software as part of employee monitoring software to help track employee productivity.
Information technology departments can use keylogger software to troubleshoot issues on a device.
How to Protect Yourself Against Keylogging Attacks on Personal Devices
The best protection against keylogging attacks is education about how the attacks occur. Consider the following precautions you can take to avoid becoming a victim:
Verify that emails are sent from legitimate sources. Check for unusual email addresses and consider whether requests are legitimate. For example, question whether your bank would ask you to reset your password in an email. When in doubt, avoid clicking the link. You can still perform the requested action, such as resetting your password, directly from your bank’s portal.
Verify that websites are legitimate. Cybercriminals often create convincing fake versions of popular websites. Before entering personal information, such as a social security number, check that the website has a digital certificate to validate its security.
Use a unique and strong password. It’s important to use unique passwords so that cybercriminals don’t have access to all your accounts if a password is compromised.
Warning Signs to Help Detect Keyloggers
There are three primary warning signs that can help you detect keyloggers:
A slow browser
